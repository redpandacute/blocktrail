# blocktrail
This is a Minecraft related project inspired by Baritone.

The idea is to create a mod for Minecraft that is able to find the most efficient path from a point A to a point B within reasonable time. In order to achieve this goal I'm planning to implement a variation of the **LPA*** algorithm aswell as variation of the very similar **D*****Lite** algorithm.

If you are interested in contributing yourself or in my plans for this project, feel free to add me on Discord under "n√∂d nett#6781"
